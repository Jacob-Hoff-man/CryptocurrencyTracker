# CryptocurrencyTracker
An iOS application that allows the user to track cryptocurrencies within the system's database. The application maximizes the amount of features provided for modularity and detailed viewing for the user, such as sorting functionality and detailed breakouts of each cryptocurrency. Additionally, the user has access to a favorites list and investment tracking. This project was developed using Agile practices and was based on an accompanying [Software Requirements Specifications](https://github.com/Jacob-Hoff-man/CryptocurrencyTracker/blob/master/CryptoTracker%20Software%20Requirements%20Specifications.pdf) document that was assigned as a senior group project for the CS1753 course at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.
